#Overview
This project is a sub-project of the [JVM Development Environment](https://github.com/kurron/jvm-development-environment). 
The Ansible plays described here will be applied to the Vagrant environment being built.  The purpose of this project 
is to install a variety of development tools into the Vagrant box.

#Prerequisites
Nothing additional to what is required by the JVM Development Environment project. 

#Building
All the components of the environment live in repositories on the internet so there is nothing to build.

#Installation
This project is intended to be invoked by the JVM Development Environment project so there is no installation step.
